### Changed

Big thanks go to NathanaÃ«l Marion ([Natrium729](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/natrium729)), who contributed these changes:

* Improved syntax highlighting with better, more fine-grained and redefined scopes.
* Improved language configuration by adding a word pattern, such that VS Code's word completion will now work better for Dialog files and take into account leading sigils such as `$` or `#`.

## 1.0.0 - 2019-09-13

Initial release.
